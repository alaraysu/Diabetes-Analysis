Diabetes Analysis and Modeling
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and modeling of the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and the development of a predictive model to identify the presence of diabetes in patients. The steps involved in this analysis are detailed below:

Steps Included
1. Data Exploration and Preparation

Initial Data Inspection: The dataset's shape, data types, and basic statistics are displayed.
Missing Values: Identification and handling of missing values are performed.
2. Variable Identification
Numerical and Categorical Variables: Identification and classification of variables into numerical, categorical, and categorical but cardinal types.
3. Analysis
Categorical Variables Analysis: Summary statistics and visualization of categorical variables.
Numerical Variables Analysis: Summary statistics and visualization of numerical variables.
Numerical Variables According to the Target: Analysis of numerical variables with respect to the target variable.
4. Correlation Analysis
